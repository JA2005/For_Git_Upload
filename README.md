R is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in bioinformatics. I have explained some basics terms used in R. 

Following topics are briefly explained:
- Data Frames 
- Lists
- Some Random functions and opertions
- Factors 
- Matrices 
- if statements

I have written a short code for finding the square of any number(Square_Code), try it and have fun.
